# Greetings Teachers!!

* Welcome to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Train the Trainer (T3) Session

**_Objective_**_: Preparing and Equipping YOU to teach YOUR students about Azure Fundamentals and prepare them to take, and hopefully successfully pass the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam (AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.)_

## Though it is a foundational course – this gateway course will be a great starter on a path of Azure and cloud Certification.

Getting Started for Teachers.

**Step 1** – Access the Curriculum for Teachers and Trainers_

_Though a bit of a tricky step, this is arguably the most frustrating process of kicking off this course and our learning for the next few sessions. We will spend out time in 3 areas:_

· _Review Learning Modules of the Azure Fundamentals Course on Microsoft Learn_

· _Review Learning Support Materials accessible through the Microsoft Downloads Center_

· _Creating a Culture of Community and Learning Around best pedagogical practices, building an ark of learning and teaching resources that will help meet students where THEY are (and not necessarily where professionals expect they should be._

### I want you to be an active participant in this process

###   
Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

This course provides foundational-level knowledge of Microsoft Azure cloud services and cloud computing concepts. Learning focus areas include cloud computing services and models of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It covers Microsoft Azure services and solutions including security, privacy, compliance, trust, pricing, and support services available. Completion of the course prepares students for the _[AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals)_ certification exam.

Next Steps:  Please review the first section of the MSLearn content before we meet next week.

The content provided by Microsoft Learn is open to the public and self-paced. There’s about 10 hours of content in this ‘path’ and it tracks almost identically to what you will deliver in class (so feel free to use it as an aid). Both sets of materials prepare the learner for the AZ900 exam. The first module is ‘Cloud Concepts’ and I suspect it will be the one we will need to spend the most time reviewing - some of the concepts (or those that underly them) may be less familiar to you.

[Azure fundamentals – General Learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)

[Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/)

All that said, please take an hour and go through the first section (or more if you wish) and bring your questions! I will try to keep the kickoff focused on the general goals, while the 2 hour session in the afternoon will be to review and discuss cloud concepts.

The links Heather provided below will get you access to the instructor curriculum. If you can’t get access this weekend, don’t sweat it. This isn’t critical for day one.
